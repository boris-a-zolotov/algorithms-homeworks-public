# algorithms-homeworks-public
Homeworks on Algorithms, Spring semester 2024, published so that you can correct
inaccuracies in the problems (and earn some points)


## Objectives
To make statements match the solutions presented during the course,
to correct typos and gaps in the problems, to eliminate ambiguity in the understanding of the tasks,
to specify the details of the algorithms that are discussed.


## Rules
Try to make problems reflect clearly what counts as a solution. Remember though that
no problem should become trivial after your correction, as well as no statement should
include any significant part of the corresponding solution.


## Moderation
I have the backup of the homeworks, and *git* sees who did what,
so any commits welcome.


## Have fun!
